## 🚧 WHAT'S BLOCKING US

### Primary Blocker: Visual Tracker Repository Access

**Problem:** Need to review Visual Tracker architecture to complete analysis.

**What We Know:**
- Visual Tracker is a bug tracking/issue management SPA
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Auth: Supabase authentication with auto-provisioning
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Location: Supposed to be in `apps/visual_tracker/` but not found

**What We've Tried:**
- Cloned `https://github.com/newger-code/real-estate-core` - has AVM platform, no Visual Tracker
- Checked for `apps/` folder - doesn't exist in that repo

**What We Need:**
- Correct GitHub repository URL (if different repo)
- Branch name (if not main/master)
- Correct path to Visual Tracker code

**What to Ask User/Other LLM:**
```
Hi! I need access to the Visual Tracker application code.

GitHub Repository: https://github.com/newger-code/real-estate-core
Expected Path: apps/visual_tracker/

This path doesn't exist in the main branch. Can you help me find:
1. Is Visual Tracker in a different repository?
2. Is it in a different branch?
3. Is the path different than apps/visual_tracker/?

Visual Tracker is described as React + TypeScript + Vite frontend with
FastAPI backend using Supabase auth. Where can I find it?
```

**Once We Have Access:**
1. Review Supabase auth implementation (AuthContext.tsx, user_sync.py)
2. Study multi-tenancy patterns (if present)
3. Document database schema design
4. Extract reusable patterns
5. Update STRATEGIC_PLAN.md with final recommendations
6. Make go/no-go decision on backend migration

---

## 🎯 KEY DECISIONS PENDING

### Decision 1: Backend Migration (YES/NO)
**Question:** Invest 12 weeks to build FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL?

**Current State:**
- Pure JavaScript frontend (works, but limited)
- No database (data in .js files)
- No API (can't integrate with marketplace)
- No multi-tenancy (can't isolate customer data)

**Option A: YES - Build Backend**
- **Pros:** Marketplace-ready, API integration, data isolation, scalable
- **Cons:** $60K-100K investment, 12 weeks dev time
- **Timeline:** 12 weeks to production
- **ROI:** Breakeven Year 2, profitable Year 3

**Option B: NO - Keep Pure JS**
- **Pros:** No investment, works now, good for internal tool
- **Cons:** Can't integrate with marketplace, not SaaS-ready
- **Timeline:** Continue iterating on current version
- **ROI:** Internal tool only (no revenue)

**User Preference (From Session):**
> "Integrate it potentially into marketplace.picket.ai and potentially have it
> be behind a feature flag and 3rd party users on the new picket/rebuilt platform
> get it either as an incentive (promotion) or as extra cost to the platform"

**Recommendation:** **Option A (YES)** - User wants marketplace integration, which requires backend.

---

### Decision 2: Chart Library (Chart.js vs Keep SVG)
**Question:** Upgrade from hand-drawn SVG to professional chart library?

**Current State:**
- Hand-drawn SVG charts (functional but basic)
- No interactivity (no hover tooltips, zoom, etc.)
- Hard to maintain (manual coordinate calculations)

**Option A: Chart.js (~200KB)**
- **Pros:** Beautiful, interactive, animations, easy to maintain
- **Cons:** 200KB bundle size (acceptable)
- **Effort:** 2-3 weeks to refactor all charts

**Option B: Chart.js + Plotly.js (~3.2MB total)**
- **Pros:** Chart.js + stunning geographic heatmap (Plotly)
- **Cons:** Larger bundle (but Plotly only loads on Markets tab)
- **Effort:** 3-4 weeks

**Option C: Keep SVG**
- **Pros:** No work, no bundle size
- **Cons:** Unimpressive, hard to maintain

**User Feedback:**
> "your graphs in past have been weak - is there a better plug in or solution...
> research 'matplotlib + Seaborn' or similar. you should be able to do better"

**Recommendation:** **Option A (Chart.js)** - Professional charts impress prospects, 200KB is worth it.

---

### Decision 3: Tech Stack Validation (After Visual Tracker Review)
**Question:** Confirm FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Supabase is right stack?

**Pending:** Visual Tracker review to validate Supabase patterns

**Likely Stack:**
- ✅ FastAPI (validated by AVM, likely Visual Tracker too)
- ✅ PostgreSQL (needed for multi-tenancy)
- ✅ Supabase Auth (if Visual Tracker shows good patterns)
- ✅ Chart.js (professional charts)
- ✅ Pure JS frontend (keep for now, React later if needed)

### Step 4: Make Go/No-Go Decision
**Action:** Present final recommendation to user
**Question:** "Do you want to commit to 12-week backend migration?"
**Decision Factors:**
- marketplace.picket.ai integration required? (YES based on session)
- Budget available? ($60K-100K dev cost)
- Timeline acceptable? (12 weeks to production)

**Deliverable:** Clear YES/NO decision documented
**Time:** User decision

### Step 5: If YES - Begin Phase 1
**Action:** Start FastAPI backend development
**First Tasks:**

3. Implement Supabase JWT validation (copy from Visual Tracker)
4. Create first API endpoint (/api/v1/commissions/import)

**Deliverable:** Working API accepting JSON imports
**Time:** Week 1-2 of 12-week plan

### Step 6: If NO - Continue Pure JS Iteration
**Action:** Keep iterating on current v2 platform
**Focus:** Internal tool optimization
**Skip:** Backend, API, marketplace integration

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM THIS SESSION

### 1. Market Research Findings
**Conclusion:** Commission Intelligence as **standalone SaaS = weak market fit**

**Why:**
- Small TAM (wholesaling is niche within niche)
- Strong competition (Brokermint $99-159/user/month, Paperless Pipeline $49/month)
- Standalone commission software hard to sell (needs bundled features)

**Better Strategy:** **Marketplace.picket.ai add-on**
- Bundled with existing platform (easier sell)
- Existing customer relationship (lower CAC)
- Feature flag monetization ($49-79/month add-on)
- Realistic revenue: $30K-80K/year by Year 2

### 2. Anti-Bot Strategy Lesson
**Discovery:** Bright Data cancelled - too slow, degraded performance

**Solution:** Custom approach works better:
- Browser rotation (randomize User-Agent)
- Human-like cursor movements
- Variable time delays (2-8 seconds)
- Simple mimicry > expensive proxies (for low-volume scraping)

**Apply to Future Projects:** Test simple approaches before buying expensive services.

### 3. FastAPI as Standard
**Validation:** Both AVM platform and Visual Tracker use FastAPI

**Why:**
- Modern, async-first
- Auto-generates API docs (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Type hints → Pydantic validation → fewer bugs
- Fast development iteration

**Recommendation:** Use FastAPI for Commission Intelligence backend.

### 4. User Priorities (From Session)
**Primary:**
1. Integrate with marketplace.picket.ai (feature flag)
2. Data isolation for 3rd party users (firewall)
3. API-first design (JSON push/pull)
4. Professional charts that impress

**Secondary:**
1. Sprint bonus fields editable (like original calculator)
2. Multi-tenancy architecture
3. Supabase auth integration

**Not Priorities:**
1. Accounting software integration (just API, they can integrate)
2. Complex forecasting (simple linear is fine for MVP)
