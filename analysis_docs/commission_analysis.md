## Key Methodology Differences: Their Calcs vs Our Initial Calcs

### 1. **Tier Bumping**
- **Their method:** Some agents are manually "bumped" to higher tiers
  - Example: Alec Prieto has $124,972 GP (should be Tier 5), but **bumped to Tier 6**
  - Note in file: "*bumped to Tier 6"
- **Our method:** Strict tier calculation based on GP ranges

### 2. **Sprint Bonuses**
- **Their method:** Added as separate line items ($2,550 Acq + $1,950 Dispo = **$4,500**)
- **Our method:** Initially not included in calculations

### 3. **Manager Commissions**
- **Their method:** Team Leaders (TLs) appear in both agent AND manager tabs
  - Agents like Luis Guzman, Shon Yoshida, Joe Haupt, Maegan Grace show $0 in agent payout
  - Their full compensation appears in Manager tabs (e.g., Luis Guzman: $8,780.43)
- **Our method:** Did not account for manager/TL compensation initially

### 4. **Commission Splits**
- **Their method:** Some deals have multiple agents (e.g., 164 Mcconnells Trce has Warren Smith + Scott Pennebaker)
  - Scott Pennebaker listed separately with Trx # = 0, but his $10K GP counts toward totals
- **Our method:** Only counted Trx # = 1 deals once

### 5. **GP Differences**
- **Alec Prieto Example:**
  - **Their GP:** $124,972 ($93,403 off-market + $31,569 flat-fee)
  - **Our GP:** $114,972 (missing the $10K split with Scott Pennebaker)
