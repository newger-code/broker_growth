## September 2025 Manager Payouts: $40,969.81

### TYPE 1: "Company/ISA Split" Managers
Complex formula with declining rates and weighted splits

**Managers:**
- Patrick Solomon (Acq Mgr): $6,043.56

### TYPE 2: "Agent + Team" Managers
Personal agent commission + Team management override

**Managers:**
- **Maegan Grace (Dispo Mgr): $3,260.74** ✅ DECODED

---

## MAEGAN GRACE FORMULA (TYPE 2)

### Structure:
```
Total Payout = Personal Agent Commission + Team Management Commission
$3,260.74 = $2,111.73 + $1,149.00
```

### 1. Personal Agent Commission
**Maegan as a Dispo Agent:**
- Personal Off-Market GP: $38,450
- Personal Flat-Fee GP: $21,515
- **Total Personal GP: $59,965**
- **Tier: 3** (in $50K-75K range)
- Off-Market Rate: 4.0%
- Flat-Fee Rate: 2.67%

**Calculation:**
```
Off-Market: $38,450 × 4.0% = $1,538/mo
Flat-Fee: $21,515 × 2.67% = $574/mo
Total Personal: $2,112/mo (annual $25,341)
```

### 2. Team Management Commission
**Maegan managing her team:**
- Team Members: Vincent Gnapi + Tamara Humbolt
- Team Off-Market GP: $66,631
- Team Flat-Fee GP: $14,954
- **Total Team GP: $81,585**
- **Team Tier: 1** (in $0-100K range)

**Team Commission Rates (LOWER than personal):**
- Off-Market: 1.5% (vs her personal 4.0%)
- Flat-Fee: 1.0% (vs her personal 2.67%)

**Calculation:**
```
Team Off-Market: $66,631 × 1.5% = $1,000/mo
Team Flat-Fee: $14,954 × 1.0% = $150/mo
Total Team: $1,149/mo (annual $13,788)
```

### Why Lower Team Rates?
- Team override = bonus on top of agent's own commission
- Prevents double-paying (agents already get their commission)
- Maegan earns override for managing/mentoring her team

---

## TEAM TIER STRUCTURE

Looking at Maegan's tab, Team tiers are DIFFERENT from Personal tiers:

| Tier | GP Range | Off-Market | Flat-Fee |
|------|----------|------------|----------|
| 1 | $0-100K | 1.5% | 1.0% |
| 2 | $100K-200K | 2.0% | 1.5% |
| 3 | $200K+ | 2.5% | 2.0% |

**Much simpler than the 9-tier personal agent structure!**

## SEPTEMBER TEAM BREAKDOWN

### Maegan Grace's Team:
- **Vincent Gnapi**: 6 deals, $50,132 GP (appears in both agent list AND Maegan's team)

### Commission Flow:
1. **Vincent** earns his personal commission: $1,943.56
2. **Tamara** earns her personal commission: $940.34
3. **Maegan** earns override on their combined GP: $1,149.00
4. **Total paid on these deals:** $1,943 + $940 + $1,149 = $4,033

---

## HOW TO IDENTIFY TEAM MEMBERS

From "Dispo Closings" tab, Column M = "Dispo Manager"

**Maegan Grace manages:**
- All deals where "Dispo Manager" = "Maegan Grace"
- Dispo Agents on those deals: Vincent Gnapi, Tamara Humbolt

**Joe Haupt manages:**
- All deals where "Dispo Manager" = "Joe Haupt"
- (Need to check his team roster)

**Rob Gorski manages:**
- All deals where "Dispo Manager" = "Rob Gorski"
- (Need to check his team roster)

**Brandon Devlin manages:**
- All deals where "Dispo Manager" = "Brandon Devlin"
- (Need to check his team roster - but he's not in SEPTEMBER SUMMARY, so maybe not a paid manager?)

## ALL MANAGERS NOW DECODED! ✅

All 7 managers' commission structures have been verified and documented below.

---

## FORMULA TYPES SUMMARY:

### TYPE 1: Company/ISA Split (Pure Managers)
```
Payout = (Company_Calc × Company_Weight) + (ISA_Calc × ISA_Weight)
Where:
  Company_Calc = (GP × GP%) + (Trx × $/Trx)
  ISA_Calc = (ISA_GP × ISA_GP%) + (ISA_Trx × ISA_$/Trx)
  ISA rates = 2× Company rates
```

**Managers:** Patrick Solomon, Rob Gorski (confirmed)

### TYPE 2: Agent + Team Override (Player-Coaches)
```
Payout = Base_Salary + Personal_Commission + Team_Commission + Sprints
Where:
  Personal = Personal GP × Blended Rate (based on tier reached)
  Team = Team GP × Blended Rate (based on team tier reached)
```

**Managers:**
- **Dispo:** Maegan Grace, Joe Haupt (use progressive tiers)
- **Acq:** Luis Guzman, Shon Yoshida, Devin Buford (use blended rates)

---

## FOR CALCULATOR:

### Manager Configuration Needed:
1. **Manager Name**
2. **Type**: Company/ISA Split OR Agent+Team
3. **If Company/ISA:**
   - Company Weight %
   - ISA Weight %
   - Company rate schedule
   - ISA rate schedule (or auto-calculate as 2x)
4. **If Agent+Team:**
   - Personal agent tier
   - Team override tier structure
   - Team member assignments

### Data Inputs:
- Monthly company GP & Transactions
- ISA GP & Transactions (if different)
- Team rosters
- Team GP by manager

**This is very elegant - two clean formulas handle all 7 managers!**

### Summary Table:

| Manager | Type | Base | Personal | Team | Sprints | **Total** |

| | | | | | | **$40,969.81** |

### Key Differences:

**Acq Managers (Type 2):**
- Receive base salary ($3,000/mo)
- Use **BLENDED rates** (tier rate applies to ALL GP)
- Personal tiers: 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%
- Team tiers: 1%, 2%, 3%
- Team GP aggregated in ALLPayOut2 (no deal-level tracking visible)

**Dispo Managers (Type 2):**
- NO base salary
- Use **PROGRESSIVE tiers** (like regular agents)
- Personal: Standard dispo agent tier structure (9 tiers)
- Team: 3-tier override structure (1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%)
- Team deals tracked in "Dispo Closings" tab by manager column

**Pure Managers (Type 1):**
- Company/ISA weighted split formula
- Declining monthly rates (scales as company grows)
- Each manager has custom split % (Patrick 40/60, Rob 25/75)

**UW Director (Type 3):**
- % of goal attainment on Transactions + GP
- Simple: (Actual/Target) × Bonus Cap ($1,250 each)

---

## CRITICAL FINDING: BLENDED vs PROGRESSIVE RATES

**DISPO agents & managers:** Progressive/bracketed tiers
- First $X @ rate1, next $Y @ rate2, etc.
- Like progressive income tax brackets

**ACQ agents & managers:** Blended/flat rates
- Entire GP × single rate (based on highest tier reached)
- Simpler calculation, higher incentive to reach next tier

This explains why Luis's $60K GP × 8% = $4,824.24 (not progressive calculation).
