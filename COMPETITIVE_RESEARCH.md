# Competitive Research Report
**Project:** Rebuilt.com (Picket.ai Merger) Strategic Positioning
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Purpose:** Board & VC Presentation Intelligence

---

## Executive Summary

Rebuilt.com (merged with Picket.ai) has a **clear path to differentiation** in the wholesale real estate market by solving the industry's dead lead problem—a gap that InvestorLift, New Western Realty, and EasyStreetOffers all fail to address.

**Key Insight:** None of the three major competitors monetize dead leads, and only New Western has an agent network (which suffers from 47% annual attrition). Rebuilt's hybrid model—AI platform + middle-tier agent network + open marketplace—captures value others leave on the table.

## Competitor Analysis

### 1. InvestorLift

**Business Model:** SaaS platform for wholesalers ($8K-$45K/year)

**Strengths:**
- AI-powered buyer matching
- 1M+ buyer database access
- Established brand (3,000+ wholesalers)
- $9B+ transactions processed

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- ❌ **50% contract fallout rate** (acknowledged, unsolved)
- ❌ No dead lead solution
- ❌ No agent network (pure software)
- ❌ No retail buyer access (investor-only)
- D- BBB rating (poor customer service)
- $8K+ annual lock-in (no free trial)

---

### 2. New Western Realty

**Business Model:** Full-service brokerage ($17B+ lifetime volume, 1,000+ agents)

**Strengths:**

- ❌ No third-party marketplace (only New Western inventory)
- ❌ No retail buyer option (investor-only)
- High-pressure culture ("must be your lifestyle")

**Differentiation Opportunity:** Rebuilt's agent model = company-provided leads + lower pressure = better retention

---

## Strategic Positioning

### Unique Value Proposition

> **"Rebuilt.com is the only platform that combines AI technology, agent support, open marketplace aggregation, and dead lead monetization to capture both investor AND retail opportunities."**

### Three Pillars of Differentiation

#### 1. Dead Lead Monetization Engine (Unique IP)
- **Problem:** 50% contract fallout rate (InvestorLift admits this), no competitor solves it
- **Rebuilt Solution:** Middle-tier agent network captures 3,500 dead leads/month
- **Impact:** $200K-$1M+ monthly incremental revenue from "wasted" leads
- **Proof:** Chris Craddock case study ($62K assignment fee from dead lead)

#### 2. Open Multi-Sided Marketplace (Network Effects)
- **Problem:** InvestorLift is closed (members only), New Western/EasyStreet only list own inventory
- **Rebuilt Solution:** ANY wholesaler can list, creating liquidity
- **Impact:** Platform earns commission on ALL transactions (asset-light model)
- **Competitive Moat:** More wholesalers → more deals → more buyers → more wholesalers

#### 3. Hybrid Tech + Human Model (Best of Both)
- **Problem:** InvestorLift has tech but no service; New Western has agents but 47% churn
- **Rebuilt Solution:** Picket AI + middle-tier agents with company-provided leads
- **Impact:** Better retention (less pressure) + higher conversion (retail exits)
- **Agent Advantage:** Not sourcing deals, multiple exit strategies, better training

---

## Market Opportunity

**TAM:** $17B+ (New Western volume) + $9B (InvestorLift processed) + fragmented regional wholesalers

**Addressable Pain Points:**
1. Dead leads (50% fallout = massive waste)
2. Agent retention crisis (47% churn at New Western)
3. Lack of open marketplace (buyers want aggregated inventory)
4. Single-exit dependency (investor-only limits opportunities)

---

---

## Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| **Agent Retention** (New Western's weakness) | Better training, company leads, lower pressure, multiple exits |
| **Wholesaler Adoption** (InvestorLift brand) | Lower cost, dead lead monetization, open marketplace benefits |
| **Buyer Liquidity** (Network effects) | Start with 3,500 monthly leads, add marketplace later |
| **Property Quality** (New Western's reputation) | Transparent analytics, verified wholesalers, buyer reviews |
| **Tech Differentiation** (vs InvestorLift AI) | Focus on unique workflows (dead leads, retail buyers, multi-exit) |

## Final VC/Board Talking Points

1. **Unique Problem:** "We solve the industry's 50% contract fallout rate that generates zero revenue for competitors"

4. **Network Effects:** "Multi-sided marketplace compounds value: more wholesalers → more deals → more buyers → more agents"

5. **Capital Efficiency:** "Asset-light platform vs. New Western's capital-intensive inventory model"

6. **Defensible Moat:** "Picket AI + agent network + dead lead IP + marketplace liquidity = hard to replicate"

7. **Clear Differentiation:** "InvestorLift has tech but no agents; New Western has agents but high churn and closed inventory; we have both with better economics"
