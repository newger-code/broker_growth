## 🎯 The Strategic Story

### 1. Declining Rate Advantage
Your commission structure is smarter than competitors:
- **Most companies:** Fixed rates → Double revenue = double commission expense
- **Your model:** Declining rates → Managers earn more $ but lower % as they scale
- **Result:** Commission % drops from 15.8% to 13.8% over 12 months

### 2. Efficiency Multiplier (Picket Technology)
Technology improves productivity without adding headcount:
- **18.4%** increase in GP per agent
- **12.1%** increase in deals per agent
- **15.0%** faster closing times
- **Result:** Grow $75K/mo additional GP with same team size

### 3. Manager Leverage Model
Player-coaches create exponential value:
- **Type 2 managers** produce personal GP + manage teams
- **Team override rates** (1-3%) incentivize growth without double-paying
- **Target:** 2.0x+ leverage (team + personal = 2x personal alone)
- **Result:** Scale capacity without proportional commission growth

### Combined Impact:
**Revenue grows faster than commission expense grows = Sustainable scaling**
