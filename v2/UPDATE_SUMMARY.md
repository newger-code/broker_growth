# Updates Made - Data Cleanup + Tab 5

## âœ… Completed:

### 1. Data Moved to Separate File
- Created `js/data.js` with all commission data
- Removed ~130 lines of embedded JSON from HTML
- HTML is now clean and readable
- Still works with file:// protocol (no CORS issues)

### 2. Ready to Add:

**Tab 5: Detailed Commission Report**
- Full agent-by-agent breakdown (like commission_dashboard.html)
- Manager detail cards
- Sortable tables
- Export functions

**Financial Model Integration:**
- Link to `/sensitivity/index.html` from header
- "Open Financial Model" button
- Opens in new tab for side-by-side analysis

## Next Steps:

Should I:
1. Add Tab 5 now with detailed agent/manager tables?
2. Add link to sensitivity tool in header?
3. Both?

Let me know and I'll implement!
