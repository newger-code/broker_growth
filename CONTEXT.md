2. **Track efficiency gains** from Picket technology integration
3. **Enable forecasting** with scenario modeling (coming Sprint 2)
4. **Provide executive analytics** for team, board, and investor presentations

## üìä Critical Business Data (September 2025 Baseline)

**Source File:** `/v2/js/data.js`

### Top-Level Metrics:
- **Total GP:** $682,043
- **Total Commission Paid:** $97,539.31
- **Commission % of GP:** 14.3%
- **Total Transactions:** 59 deals
- **Team Size:** 32 people (15 Acq agents, 17 Dispo agents)

### Commission Structure Decoded:

**8 Managers Across 3 Types:**

**Type 1: Company/ISA Split** (Declining rates on cumulative GP)
- Patrick Solomon (Acq Manager) - $9,850.30
- Rob Gorski (Dispo Manager) - $10,128.64

**Type 2: Agent + Team Override** (Player-coach model)
- Luis Guzman (Acq Manager) - $5,784.42
- Shon Yoshida (Acq Manager) - $10,324.96
- Devin Buford (Acq Manager) - $5,569.84
- Joe Haupt (Dispo Manager) - $16,849.89
- Maegan Grace (Dispo Manager) - $9,006.16

**Type 3: % of Goal Attainment** (UW Director)
- Dustin Hepburn - $682.04 (0.1% of GP when txns ‚â• 90% of goal)

**Agent Tiers:**

**Acquisition Agents (Blended Rates):**
- Tier 1: 4% (up to $100K cumulative GP)
- Tier 2: 6% ($100K-$200K)
- Tier 3: 8% ($200K-$300K)
- Tier 4: 10% (>$300K)

**Disposition Agents (Progressive Tiers):**
- 9 tiers from $0 to $250K+ cumulative GP
- Rates increase with production volume

### Key Pattern Discovered:
**Commission % is declining over time (15.8% in Jan ‚Üí 14.3% in Sep)**
- This is GOOD - shows sustainable scaling
- Revenue grows faster than commission expense
- Result of declining rate tiers + efficiency gains

## üîë Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Declining Rate Advantage
The commission structure is designed to reduce % of GP as agents scale:
- **Competitors:** Fixed rates ‚Üí 2x revenue = 2x commission expense
- **This model:** Declining rates ‚Üí 2x revenue = ~1.7x commission expense
- **Impact:** Commission % drops from 15.8% to 14.3% over 9 months

### 2. Picket Technology Efficiency Gains
Baseline comparisons show measurable improvements:
- **+18.4%** GP per agent (vs pre-Picket)
- **+12.1%** deals per agent
- **+5.6%** GP per deal (better quality)
- **-15.0%** days to close (faster velocity)

### 3. Manager Leverage Model
Type 2 managers are player-coaches:
- Earn commission on **personal production** (as agents)
- Earn **team override** (1-3% on team's GP)
- **Target:** 2.0x+ leverage (team + personal = 2x personal alone)
- **Reality:** Currently averaging 2.1x leverage

### 4. Data Sources
- **September 2025:** REAL baseline data from actual commission calculations
- **Jan-Aug 2025:** SYNTHETIC data (realistic projections for demo purposes)
- **Deal-level data:** SYNTHETIC (property addresses are fictional)
- **Geographic data:** SYNTHETIC but realistic (15 real markets)

## üö® Critical Issues / Known Limitations

### Data Quality:
- ‚úÖ **September 2025 is REAL** (reconciled to the penny: $97,539.31)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Jan-Aug 2025 is SYNTHETIC** (need actual CRM exports to replace)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deal-level transactions are SYNTHETIC** (property addresses fictional)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Termination reasons are PLACEHOLDER** (need tracking system)

### Missing Data (Future Needs):
1. **Historical actuals:** Need CRM export for Jan-Aug 2025 real data
2. **Deal-level log:** Transaction records with property, agent, market, GP, dates
3. **Termination tracking:** System to capture why deals fall through
4. **Market geographic data:** ZIP codes, neighborhoods (currently city-level only)

### Technical Limitations:
- No date range filtering yet (shows all data, can't customize periods)
- No export to PDF/CSV functionality
- Forecast is simple linear (not ML-powered)
- No email alerts for performance issues
- Mobile responsive design needs work

## üí° Key Insights Currently Visible

### From Predictive Insights Tab:
- **3 agents declining >10%** in recent quarter (need intervention)
- **Columbus OH: 38.1% termination rate** (highest risk market)
- **Phoenix & Nashville: Best markets** (13.8% and 14.5% termination)
- **Off-market deals: 23% higher GP** than flat-fee MLS
- **Inspection issues: #1 termination cause** (fixable process problem)
- **$1.3M combined opportunity** across 4 strategic initiatives

### From Efficiency Tab:
- **Commission % declining** (good - sustainable scaling)
- **65% current utilization** (35% growth headroom before next hire)
- **8 months until next hire needed** (based on current growth rate)
- **Manager leverage: 2.1x average** (player-coach model working)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Make Changes

### To Update Commission Formulas:
Edit `/v2/js/core/calculations.js` - all formulas centralized here

### To Add New Data:
- **September baseline:** Update `/v2/js/data.js` (window.COMMISSION_DATA)
- **Historical data:** Update `/v2/js/data_extended.js` (window.EXTENDED_DATA)

### To Create New Tab:
1. Create `/v2/js/tabs/your-tab.js` with init() function
2. Add tab button + panel to `/v2/index.html`
3. Add script tag for your file
4. Add case to initTabContent() in `/v2/js/app.js`
5. Follow existing tab pattern (see agent-timeline.js for example)

### To Modify Design:
- **Colors/spacing:** `/v2/css/variables.css` (design tokens)
- **Layout/grid:** `/v2/css/layout.css`
- **Components:** `/v2/css/components.css`

## üí¨ Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is the data real?**
A: September 2025 baseline is 100% real. Jan-Aug history is synthetic but realistic. Deal-level data is synthetic for demo.

**Q: Can I trust the commission calculations?**
A: Yes - September reconciles to $97,539.31 (within $0.66 of target). All formulas decoded and validated.

**Q: What's the declining rate advantage?**
A: As agents scale, their commission % drops but $ amount increases. Revenue grows faster than commission expense. This is by design and proves sustainable scaling.

**Q: Why build this vs using existing tools?**
A: Existing tools (Zoho, Salesforce, etc.) don't understand our unique commission structure. This platform encodes our specific formulas and tells our efficiency story.

**Q: What's next to build?**
A: Forecast tab (Tab 1) with sliders for scenario modeling. User wants to model "what if we grow 50% but only hire 2 agents?"

**Q: How do I add real historical data?**
A: Export CRM data to CSV, transform to match `data_extended.js` structure, replace synthetic data. Takes ~1 hour.
